# Grammars
An algorithm to create sentences following the rues of an invented grammar.

## Mathematically
The depicted grammar is kind of a context-free grammar (only kind of). However, it follows the priciples of context free grammars:
<br><br>
> G = (V, ∑, R, S), where:

- `G` is a Grammar
- `V` is a set of non-terminal symbols (= variables); e.g. P (for sentence)
- `∑` is a set of terminal symbols, e.g. "4"
- `R` is a set of rules; (a,b) element of R; a -> b
- `S` is the start symbol (non-terminal); `S` element of `V`

Now we can create sentences/strings using an instance of that grammar.
